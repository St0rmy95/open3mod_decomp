Decompilation of [open3mod](https://github.com/acgessler/open3mod) by [acgessler](https://github.com/acgessler) since the released version is not up to date with the repository.



## FAQ

#### What's the purpose of the repository?

I couldn't get the original released program to work, since it used an older version of Assimp. So i decided to decompile the released version to get .tga support through DevIL working. 

#### What decompiler was used?

dnSpy

#### Was anything else done except fixing DevIL?

Yes, i restructured the folder structure a bit and renamed testscenes to SampleScenes to get it inline with the UI representation.
